\f0\fs24 \cf0 I am using photoshop and I have learned a little bit on layering. The only thing that I think that is confusing here is how my PS is not letting me see the layers how they are usually in the tutorials. I do want to learn how to use the select tool because although layering would work for the image I have in mind I do not think that it will do what I want to do justice. There is going to have to be some pieces that are selected and moved onto the backgrounds of the main picture, and the added text. \

March 2/21: I have now learned how to use the lasso tool to a point, and I have also learned how to layer the images in the way that I want them to be layered. I have also chosen to not use text anymore in my argument, I think that this will take away from what I want the focus to be.  }
