Idea for GIMP Project

 Black Lives Matter image: mostly black and white hints of yellow, and add red over the middle of it? There should be a red line in the middle that says justice.




 - fist
 - black and white
 - hands covering a mouth
 - hanging
 - flag
 



I almost think now after working on this a little bit, that it is a less is more argument.
